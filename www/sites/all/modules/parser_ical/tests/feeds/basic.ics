DESCRIPTION:Oct. 26\, 12:52 a.m. EDT - The Full Hunter's Moon. With the
 leaves falling and the deer fattened\, it is time to hunt. Since the fie
 lds have been reaped\, hunters can ride over the stubble\, and can more
 easily see the fox\, also other animals that have come out to glean and
 can be caught for a thanksgiving banquet after the harvest. The Moon wil
 l also be at perigee later this day\, at 7:00 a.m.\, at a distance of 22
 1\,676 miles from Earth. Very high tides can be expected from the coinci
 dence of perigee with full Moon.\n\nhttp://www.space.com/spacewatch/0612
